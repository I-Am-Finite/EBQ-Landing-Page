This is a responsive mock landing page built for EBQ using HTML, CSS, and JS.
Everything is clearly labeled.
I chose to do a modal element for the disfunctional "Contact Us" buttons as my event-listener of choice.
It was one of the only ones that made sense and as the site was clearly missing that as a function, I made it.
